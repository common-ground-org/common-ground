# CommonGround
## Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform for Public Goods

### Overview
CommonGround is a decentralized crowdfunding platform designed to support public goods. By combining Web2 usability with Web3 infrastructure and AI-powered features, CommonGround aims to make public goods crowdfunding accessible, trustless, and user-friendly for all.

### Features
* AI-Native User Experience: Simplifies project creation and milestone evaluation with AI agents.
* Decentralized Infrastructure: Built on blockchain technology for trustless operations.
* Cross-Community Access: Welcomes both Web2 and Web3 users for smooth onboarding.
### Roles
* **Contributor**
 1. Provides funds, ideas, or resources to projects.
 2. Receives perks (rights or obligations) tied to public goods.
* **Initiator**
 1. Creates public good projects with AI assistance.
 2. Defines project milestones, perks, and manages progress.
 3. Funding is released upon milestone achievement.
* **Evaluator**
 1. Stakes tokens to verify project milestones.
 2. Runs AI agents within TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) to evaluate milestones.
 3. Earns staking rewards but faces slashing for malicious actions.
### Architecture
#### Integrations
* **Polygon POS**: Main blockchain for CommonGround.
* **Phala Network**: Provides the TEE environment for AI evaluation agents.
